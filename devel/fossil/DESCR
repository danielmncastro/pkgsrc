There are plenty of open-source version control systems available on the
Internet these days. What makes Fossil worthy of attention?

 1. Bug Tracking And Wiki - In addition to doing distributed version control
 like Git and Mercurial, Fossil also supports distributed bug tracking and
 distributed wiki all in a single integrated package.

 2. Web Interface - Fossil has a built-in and easy-to-use web interface that
 simplifies project tracking and promotes situational awareness. Simply type
 "fossil ui" from within any check-out and Fossil automatically opens your web
 browser in a page that gives detailed history and status information on that
 project.

 3. Autosync - Fossil supports "autosync" mode which helps to keep projects
 moving forward by reducing the amount of needless forking and merging often
 associated distributed projects.

 4. Self-Contained - Fossil is a single stand-alone executable that contains
 everything needed to do configuration management. Installation is trivial:
 simply download a precompiled binary for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on
 your $PATH. Easy-to-compile source code is available for users on other
 platforms. Fossil sources are also mostly self-contained, requiring only the
 "zlib" library and the standard C library to build.
