This package provides the following PostgreSQL modules: citext, hstore,
intarray, isn, ltree, lo, uuid-ossp, and unaccent. The "citext" module provides
a case-insensitive character string type, citext.

The "hstore" module implements the "hstore" data type for storing sets of
key/value pairs within a single PostgreSQL value.

The "intarray" module provides a number of useful functions and operators for
manipulating one-dimensional arrays of integers.

The "isn" module provides data types for the following international product
numbering standards: EAN13, UPC, ISBN (books), ISMN (music), and ISSN (serials).

The "ltree" module implements a data type ltree for representing labels of data
stored in a hierarchical tree-like structure.

The "lo" module provides support for managing Large Objects (also called LOs or
BLOBs). This includes a data type "lo" and a trigger "lo_manage."

The "uuid-ossp" module provides functions to generate universally unique
identifiers (UUIDs) using one of several standard algorithms.

"unaccent" is a text search dictionary that removes accents (diacritic signs)
from lexemes.
