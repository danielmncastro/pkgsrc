$NetBSD$

* Fix the cross-libtool crock.
* Organize NATIVE_xyz and TARGET_xyz better.
* Organize host/target compiler tools better.
* Automatically set PACKAGES=packages.${MACHINE_ARCH}.
* Automatically set WRKDIR_BASENAME=work.${MACHINE_ARCH}.
* Simplify mk.conf setup (see HOWTO-use-crosscompile).
* Make USE_CROSS_COMPILE and MACHINE_ARCH passable on the command line.
* Don't require user to set up CROSSBASE cruft.
* Allow LOCALBASE &c. to be set differently on host and target.
* Make cross-OS builds work.  Perhaps use GNU_PLATFORM, not ARCH.
